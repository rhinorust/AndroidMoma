# MapBox SDK for Xamarin

An open source SDK for pixel-perfect vector maps on iOS and Android. Maps render at the speed and smoothness of a video game. And it's free to start developing.

## Features

 - Fast, beautiful vector maps
 - Fully open source
 - Customizable map styles and layers
 - Frequent data updates from OpenStreetMap
 - User metrics dashboard *
 - Web-based map style editor
 - On-device vector rendering
 - User location services and compass tracking
 - Point and shape annotations
 - Raster tile support for satellite imagery and legacy maps
 

## Designed without clutter

Mapbox Streets, our signature map style, features bright colors and clear contrast to make every location in the world recognizable. Each zoom level is balanced to show just the right amount of information. A clean, beautiful map for every city at any zoom level.

Emerald features subtle, yet detailed hill shades. Get a glimpse at terrain before a jog or take Emerald through the city. Its detailed roads, major motorways, and metro routes will connect your users to their next adventure or lunch date.

Dark and Light are perfect styles for enhancing data. Both have just enough information to help orient users without taking the focus away from your content. Seamlessly switch from one style to the other in the same app; these styles were made to be interchanged. The clean designs of Dark and Light will make your data pop.


### Making better maps

To improve our maps, Mapbox uses anonymized location data to benefit both our customers and anyone who uses OpenStreetMap data. Together we're building a better map.


### Battery efficient

Mapbox is fast, secure, and extremely battery efficient. We tested battery usage extensively to ensure a full day's charge for your users without sacrificing performance.

### Security

Location data is highly sensitive: it contains information about where we live and our daily habits. Mapbox anonymizes, aggregates, and protects all location data.


### Data dashboards for developers

Find out how users are interacting with your map. Our new data dashboard provides a continuously updated view of your mapâ€™s usage, from what neighborhoods are popular to map usage metrics.

The iOS and Android SDKs are 100% open source, licensed under BSD with all development and discussions happening on GitHub. Read more about our approach to open source at Mapbox.

We built Mapbox in C++14 using OpenGL ES 2.0, a subset of OpenGL that is available on mobile devices. With minor changes it can also run on desktop hardware. We use protocol buffers for compact vector tiles and we've implemented custom code for text display and layout.
